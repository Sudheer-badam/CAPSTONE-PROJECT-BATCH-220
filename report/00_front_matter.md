The rapid growth of social media platforms such as Twitter (X), Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube has generated enormous volumes of user-generated content every day. This data contains valuable information about public opinions, customer experiences, emerging trends, and market behavior. However, manually analyzing such a massive amount of unstructured data is difficult, time-consuming, and inefficient. To address this challenge, this project presents an **AI-Based Social Media Sentiment and Trend Analysis Platform On Women Safety** that automatically collects, processes, analyzes, and visualizes social media data using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The platform gathers real-time posts from multiple social media sources through APIs and performs data preprocessing by removing noise, special characters, duplicate content, and irrelevant information. Advanced NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization are applied to prepare the text for analysis. Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, including VADER, TextBlob, and transformer-based models like BERT, are used to classify sentiments into **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral** categories with high accuracy. The system also identifies emotional expressions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and surprise to provide deeper insights into user opinions.

In addition to sentiment analysis, the platform detects trending topics by analyzing hashtags, keywords, user engagement, and posting frequency. AI algorithms identify emerging discussions, viral content, and public interests in real time. The analyzed results are displayed through an interactive dashboard featuring sentiment distribution charts, trend graphs, keyword frequency analysis, geographic visualizations, and time-based analytics. These visualizations enable users to understand public perception and monitor social media activity effectively.

The proposed platform is beneficial for **businesses, marketing agencies, government organizations, researchers, and brand managers** to monitor customer feedback, evaluate product performance, manage brand reputation, detect public concerns, and support data-driven decision-making. By combining Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and real-time analytics, the system provides a scalable, efficient, and intelligent solution for extracting meaningful insights from social media data. The project demonstrates how AI can transform unstructured online conversations into actionable information, enabling organizations to respond quickly to market trends and public sentiment while improving strategic planning and customer engagement.
